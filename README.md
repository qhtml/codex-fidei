# Codex Fidei

This repository compiles public-domain English translations of the sacred scriptures of Judaism (Tanakh), Christianity (Old & New Testament), and Islam (Qur’an) into a single, chronologically ordered anthology. Each text has been normalized and edited to remove references to specific ethnic groups, national identities, or violent rhetoric, and replaced with inclusive, universal language.  

**Included Sources**  
- Tanakh (Jewish Scriptures)  
- Christian Bible (Old and New Testaments)  
- Qur’an (English translation)  

**Purpose**  
The goal of this project is to preserve the ethical, spiritual, and communal core of these traditions while removing sectarian and tribal emphasis. The result is a respectful, shared foundation for reflection across faiths rather than a claim for any one tradition’s exclusivity.  

**Editing Process**  
This collection was compiled and processed with the aid of automated tools. While care has been taken to maintain fidelity to original meaning, the edits reflect a conscious choice to re-frame the texts in broadly inclusive language.  

**Feedback & Contributions**  
Questions, suggestions, or concerns about the editing choices, chronology, or translation sources are welcome. Please open an Issue in this repository to begin a discussion.
