# codex-fidei
this is a compilation of the holy books from Hebrew, Christianity, and Muslim faiths all combined together in chronological order with references to specific countries and/or groups of people reworded with generic terms  and violent rhetoric removed. 

The process of sanitizing these books was not done by hand, but rather using artficial intelligence to ensure neutrality. 

If you disagree with any changes, or timelines, feel free to report an Issue on this github repo.
